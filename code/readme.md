# ﻿Code execution instructions

1.	Make 'code' directory a working directory in R (using setwd() function in RStudio).
2.	Go to 'code’ directory and run R script 'decisionTreeGreedy.R’/'decisionTreeGreedyKfold.R’'/'decisionTreePessimisticKfold.R’'/'decisionTreeValidationsetKfold.R’'/'decisionTreeMinlengthKfold.R’'
3.	By default 'decisionTreeGreedy.R’ will run on “Blood transfusion” Data. However, you can run this code on any dataset of your choice. Just modify ‘geedy_algorithm()’ argument as described earlier. Other scripts will also automatically run on total 10 different datasets of UCI machine learning by default. You can also change the datasets
4.	Once this script is executed successfully, it will generate the output in ‘output’ directory with respective name.
