# ﻿Code execution instructions

1.	Make 'code' directory a working directory in R (using setwd() function in RStudio).
2.	Go to 'code’ directory and run R script 'decisionTreeGreedy.R’ or 'decisionTreeGreedyKfold.R’'
3.	By default 'decisionTreeGreedy.R’ will run on “Blood transfusion” Data. However, you can run this code on any dataset of your choice. Just modify ‘geedy_algorithm()’ argument as described earlier
4.	Once this script is executed successfully, it will generate the output in ‘output’ directory with name ‘output_result.csv’. Output in this file give you the Accuracy
